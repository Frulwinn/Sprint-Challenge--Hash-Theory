  HashTable *ht = create_hash_table(16);

  /* YOUR CODE HERE 
  Understanding the problem --------------
  merging two packages
  A package is given WITH (limit and weights)
  weight limit = limit
  list = weights of item weights
  FIND two items whose sum of weights == weight limit
  index_1 + index_2 == weight limit
  return instance of answer struct

  typdef struct Answer { //represents item weights of two packages
  int index_1; //place higher value weight
  int index_2; //place smaller value weight
} Answer;

  If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, 
  your function should return `NULL`.

  When calling `hash_table_retrieve` with a key that doesn't exist 
  in the hash table, `hash_table_retrieve` will return -1. 

  Example:
  ```
  input: int *weights = { 4, 6, 10, 15, 16 }, 
  int length = 5, int limit = 21
  output: Answer{ index_1: 3, index_2: 1 }  
  # since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21
  ```
  */
  //SOLUTION
  //loop through the items in the weight list

  //check if the needed key is in the hash table
  //return the index value of the key for that weights array
  //calculate the two weight number needed to equal the limit

  //if the key is not in the hash table make one
  //create the key value pairs that are inserted into the hash table

  //if a key equal to the (limit - weight) exists
  //create an instance of the answer truct

  //set the index of the weight started with

  //store the value(index) that matches

  return NULL;
}

void print_answer(Answer *answer)
{
  if (answer != NULL) {
    printf("%d %d\n", answer->index_1, answer->index_2);
  } else {
    printf("NULL\n");
  }
}
